We are Campus Aware -- professors promoting a campus culture of mutual respect
        We seek to bring awareness about the onslaught of harmful messaging on university campuses since the events of Oct 7. 
         We start by stating that our intent is in no way to stifle genuine pro-Palestinian voices for peace. 
         We ourselves dream of the day that Palestinians will achieve self-determination in their own state alongside the state of Israel. 
         However, aspects of pro-Palestinian messaging are hurtful, have generated a toxic learning environment for many Jews, and their use on campus needs to be addressed. 
         This website is intended as a resource for two audiences. First, students and faculty can use our materials to help guide their pro-Palestinian advocacy to ensure it is expressed in ways that are not harmful to Jews on campus. 
        Second, university administration and offices of equity, diversity and inclusivity (EDI or DEI depending on the country) can use our materials to help guide university policy to ensure a safe and inclusive learning environment.
        Please explore our website  to learn about issues of equity, diversity and inclusivity that affect the sense of safety, belonging and wellbeing of Jews on campus as they relate to the post October 7 world.
