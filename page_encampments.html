							<h1>Protest Encampments as a places of Exclusion</h1>
							<p>Universities are meant to be a places where academic ideas may freely flow, be challenged with arguments and facts and where people can learn to think, reason, and engage in dialogue.
							<p>University protest encampments occupied campus spaces, those with dissenting views were excluded, and an echo chamber effect of one-sided views fueled by emotion rather than reason devolved into scenes of racist and violent messaging, explicit endorsements for the murder of "Zionists" by encampment leadership, and calls for discrimination on the basis of national origin -- a human rights violation.
							<p>Equally troubling was the support given to encampments by many professors, despite full knowledge of the harmful messaging espoused.
							<p>What follows is a portion of a <a href="https://president.jhu.edu/messages/2024/05/02/update-on-protest-on-campus/">publicly available letter</a> from the President of John Hopkins University on why encampments violate the fundamental principles that healthy universities thrive under.  
<p></p>

<p><i> "The second reason for our concern with the encampment goes to its inconsistency with the core values of the university. You well know my commitment to ensuring the broadest possible protection for free speech and inquiry at the university. This commitment has been as important as ever since October 7. We know that there is a range of sincerely held and different views in our community on the nature of the war in Gaza and the multidecades conflict between Israel, the Palestinians, and neighboring states. Because this issue for many is connected to their core religious identity, the issue is even more freighted. Many in our community have family members who dwell in the region and have been killed or injured. Inevitably, the broad protection accorded speech on our campus has meant that some members of our community will find the claims and slogans made by participants in the debate offensive and hurtful. Nevertheless, absent speech that directly calls for violence or injury against protected class groups, we have neither punished nor condemned anyone’s speech."

<p>"We recognize that the encampment is useful in seizing our attention. It forces us to confront different frames or narratives on the conflict. But that is as far as it goes. By physically demarcating a space and by gathering, studying, and chanting with only those people who subscribe to a similar worldview on an incredibly complex subject, you fail to honor the university’s foundational imperative for conversation across difference, for conversation that aims to test, evaluate, and understand competing claims. An encampment of this nature cannot help but reduce the capacity of those within it to see the common humanity of those who are outside its perimeter. Instead of recognizing and drawing strength from our diversity, we veer to a community of rigid solitudes, a community defined by suspicion, distrust, and, in the extreme, hatred. Along the way, our common humanity is lost."

<p>"I acknowledge that it is hard work to stage sustained protest. But I believe the much harder work is to now move beyond the shouting, the slogans, the call and response, and to engage in a rigorous and open-minded way with the university community on the agenda for change that you propose. Along the way, you will need to marshal facts and evidence. You will need to meet the arguments and ideas of others who disagree–perhaps vehemently–with some of your claims. That is the hard work of the university and, indeed, of liberal democratic society."</i>
<p>Ron Donalds, President of John Hopkins University, 2 May 2024
