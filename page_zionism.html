							<h1> Is Zionism Racism?  (under construction)</h1>

							<p>Yes, Albert Einstein was a Zionist Jew. Many Pro-Palestinian supporters on campus claim that "Zionist are racists". 
								Could the beloved scientist who contributed so much to the world have been a racist?
								
							<p>Lets take a step back and discuss what defines a "Zionist". 
								Simply put, today a Zionist is anyone, Jewish or otherwise, who believes the state of Israel has a right to exist and to defend itself like any other state. 
								Polls taken across Canada and the United States show that more than 3 out of every 4 people are Zionists. 
								So if all zionists are racists, then that makes 75% of the population in Canada and the United States racist. Are we really racists?
							
							<p> The "racist" label applied to Zionists is just propaganda. 
								
								<!--This charge began with the communist Soviet Union.... [under construction] 
								
							<p> To say any group of people are racist or oppressors is binary thinking. Children think in binary terms. People are either good or bad. 
								University education, in contrast, is intended to open our eyes to view the world with nuance. to let go of black and white thinking and see the world of colour in all its complexity. 
							But anti-Zionist students and professors who claim that Zionists are racist or that Zionism is racism have fallen into the trap childhood mindset of binary thinking.

							<p>Amongst Zionists you will find racist individuals. But the same is true of the Pro-Palestinian movement and just about 
								every other group of people whether they be define by politics, religion, or skin colour. Some members of those groups are bound to be racist.
								Ok, but if the ideology of Zionism is inherantly racist, wouldn't that make members who espouse that ideology racist by definition. Let's explore the ideology. 

								Zionism is a fundamental belief system of the Judaism - the religion of the Jews. You cannot espouse Judasim and not be a Zionist in at least some fashion. 
								Jews are indiginous to the tiny peice of realestate variously called the "Land of Israel", "Caanon", and since the Romans renamed it after their bloodbath in ZZZ, "Palestine". located 
								
								The reason why is that 
								
								was a 19th century and early twentieth centure movement that -->
